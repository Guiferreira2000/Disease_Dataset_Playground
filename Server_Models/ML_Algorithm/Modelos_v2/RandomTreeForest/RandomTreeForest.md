# Machine Learning Model for Disease Prediction

This README aims to provide a comprehensive guide on the steps taken to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting potential diseases based on a list of symptoms.

## Dataset Overview

The data used is an augmented version of the original dataset, which ensures a more diverse set of data points. It contains the following columns:
- ICD 11 Code
- Disease
- Symptoms (from Symptom_1 to Symptom_25)

Each disease is associated with multiple symptoms, all represented by their respective ICD 11 codes.

## Common Methodology Steps

### 1. Data Loading

The `pandas` library was used to load the dataset from an Excel file. 

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Columns representing symptoms were combined into a single 'symptoms' column containing lists of symptom codes. The `MultiLabelBinarizer` from `sklearn` was employed to convert these lists into binary vectors. Both the symptoms and diseases were encoded into numeric formats using `LabelEncoder`.

### 3. Data Splitting

The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets using the `train_test_split` function from `sklearn`. This separation ensures the model is trained and validated on distinct sets of data.

## 4. Model Choice: Random Forest Classifier

    Why Random Forest?

    The Random Forest Classifier was chosen due to several reasons:
    - **Capability to Handle Many Features**: Our augmented dataset, with numerous symptom codes as features, is aptly managed by Random Forest.
    - **Overfitting Prevention**: Random Forest inherently provides mechanisms like bagging and feature randomness that help in preventing overfitting.
    - **Feature Importance**: The model gives an intrinsic capability to rank features (symptoms) by their importance, offering insights about influential symptoms for certain diseases.

    Training the Model

    The Random Forest Classifier was trained on the training subset. This phase involves the model learning the relationship between symptoms (features) and diseases (labels).

### 5. Evaluating the Model

After training, the model's performance was assessed on the testing subset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were utilized to understand its prediction capability.

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning

The primary goal of model fine-tuning is to improve its performance. Most machine learning algorithms have hyperparameters â€“ parameters that aren't learned from the data but are set prior to training. The optimal settings for these hyperparameters are usually unknown for a specific dataset, so a search must be conducted to find the best ones.
Grid Search vs. Random Search:

There are several methods to conduct this search:

    Grid Search: This involves exhaustively trying all possible combinations of the hyperparameters you want to tune. For example, if you're tuning two hyperparameters and you decide to test 5 different values for each, you'd have to train and evaluate your model 25 times.

    Random Search: Instead of testing all possible combinations, random combinations of the hyperparameters are tested. This is generally faster and, surprisingly, often yields as good or even better results than grid search.

Implementation in the code:

In the code provided earlier, we used GridSearchCV from sklearn to perform a grid search. Here's a breakdown:

    # Set up parameter grid (adjust parameters and ranges accordingly)
    param_grid = {
        'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
        'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],
        'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
    }


This sets up a grid of hyperparameters for the Random Forest model:

    n_estimators refers to the number of trees in the forest.
    max_depth sets the maximum depth of each decision tree.
    min_samples_split is the minimum number of data points placed in a node before the node is split.

    # Run grid search
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
    grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

This code initializes the grid search on the model (clf) using the parameter grid (param_grid). It evaluates each combination using 5-fold cross-validation (cv=5) and aims to optimize accuracy (scoring='accuracy').

After fitting, you can retrieve the best hyperparameters and the best estimator (model) with:

    best_params = grid_search.best_params_
    best_clf = grid_search.best_estimator_


Points to Consider:

    Computational Expense: Grid search can be computationally expensive, especially when the number of hyperparameters and their potential values increase. This is a significant advantage of random search, as you can set the number of iterations and thus control the computational time.

    Overfitting: It's important to remember that by doing extensive hyperparameter tuning, there's a risk of overfitting the validation set. Always have a separate test set that you don't use during the tuning process and evaluate your final model on it.

    Other Methods: More advanced methods, like Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, and gradient-based optimization, can be used for hyperparameter tuning but are outside the scope of a basic overview.

### 7. Predicting Diseases for New Symptoms

With the trained and fine-tuned model, it's possible to predict potential diseases for a new set of symptoms. This prediction capability can be invaluable for preliminary diagnostic tools or aids for healthcare professionals.
