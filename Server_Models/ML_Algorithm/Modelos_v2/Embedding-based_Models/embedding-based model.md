Explanation of the code

    Embedding Layer: This layer transforms the integer-encoded symptoms into dense vectors of fixed size. It's similar to word embeddings in natural language processing tasks, where words are mapped to vectors of real numbers.

    RNN Layers (LSTM): After the embedding layer, the dense vectors (embeddings) are processed by LSTM layers. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. It is capable of learning patterns over sequences, which makes it well-suited for tasks like this where the sequence of symptoms can provide information about the possible disease.

    Dense Layer: This is a fully connected neural network layer that performs the classification task based on the features extracted by the LSTM layers.

    Softmax Activation: The final layer has a softmax activation function, which essentially gives a probability distribution over all the possible disease classifications.



This entire architecture is designed to process sequences of symptom embeddings and output a prediction about the potential disease
