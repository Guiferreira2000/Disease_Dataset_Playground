Characteristics of the model:

Classification: Multiclass classification

Given that we want to predict a single disease based on a set of symptoms, it should be used a multiclass classification problem, where each disease is a separate class.


Model:



Type of Dataset:

    Size: Case the dataset might not be large enough to capture the nuances of each disease, data augmentation can be beneficial. Techniques specific to your case might include creating synthetic symptom combinations or using bootstrapping.

    Class Imbalance: If some diseases are underrepresented in the dataset, data augmentation or resampling techniques can help balance the distribution.

    Noise and Errors: If the dataset contains noise (e.g., wrongly coded symptoms or diseases), data cleaning and preprocessing should be the priority before augmentation.

    Augmentation with Embeddings: Case its used a embedding-based models, you might indirectly augment the data by translating discrete ICD codes into continuous embedding vectors. These embeddings might capture similarities and nuances which the raw codes may not represent explicitly.




Extra features:

    Demographic Information: Disease incidence rate, age, gender, ethnicity, and other demographic factors can influence the likelihood of certain diseases. For instance, some diseases are more prevalent in certain age groups or among certain genders. 

    Medical History: Past illnesses, surgeries, or other significant medical events can be relevant. For example, a patient with a history of heart disease might be at a higher risk for certain conditions compared to someone without.

    Severity of Symptoms: If quantifiable, the severity or intensity of symptoms can be crucial. For instance, mild fatigue vs. extreme fatigue can suggest different conditions.

    Symptom Interactions or Symptom Clusters: Some symptoms might frequently appear together, so creating interaction terms or identifying clusters can be beneficial.
