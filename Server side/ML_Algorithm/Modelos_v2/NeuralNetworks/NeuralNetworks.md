Preprocessing: This remains largely similar to what we discussed before. Your input data should be a matrix where each row is a sample, and the columns represent encoded symptoms, relatedness values, and severity scores.

Network Architecture:

    Input Layer: The number of nodes will be equal to the number of features.
    Hidden Layers: These will process the data. A typical architecture starts with a larger number of nodes in the first hidden layer, with subsequent layers having fewer nodes. Activation functions like ReLU (rectified linear unit) are commonly used.
    Output Layer: If it's a classification task, the number of nodes will be equal to the number of classes. For multi-class classification, you would use a softmax activation function, and for binary classification, a sigmoid activation.

Training: This involves feeding the data through the network, comparing the output to the actual labels using a loss function, and then adjusting the weights in the network using an optimization algorithm like Adam.






Explanation of the code:

Chapter 4: Data Preprocessing

    Data preprocessing is an essential step in the machine learning pipeline. It transforms raw data into a structured format suitable for training our neural network.
    4.1 Label Encoding

    We employ label encoding to convert disease labels into a format understandable by the neural network. The encoded labels are integers representing each unique disease.
    4.2 Symptom Binarization

    Since patients can have multiple symptoms, we use a MultiLabelBinarizer. This transforms the symptom lists into a binary matrix, where each column corresponds to a symptom, and a '1' indicates the presence of that symptom in a patient.

Chapter 5: Feature Engineering

    Feature engineering aims to create additional input features that can enhance the model's ability to discern patterns in the data.
    5.1 Symptom Relatedness Matrix

    To understand how symptoms relate to each other for a given patient, we compute a relatedness matrix. It provides pairwise relatedness scores between symptoms.
    5.2 Severity Scores

    Each symptom is associated with a severity score. These scores can play a crucial role in disease prediction, indicating the severity of a patient's condition.

Chapter 6: Neural Network Model Definition

    The neural network is designed to accept the binarized symptoms, relatedness matrix, and severity scores as input and predict the potential disease.
    6.1 Architecture

    The neural network has multiple Dense (fully connected) layers. The activation function 'ReLU' is used for intermediate layers because of its efficiency and ability to handle vanishing gradient problems. The output layer employs a softmax activation function to provide a probability distribution over the disease labels.
    6.2 Parameters

        Optimizer: We use the Adam optimizer, known for its efficiency and adaptiveness.
        Loss Function: 'Sparse Categorical Crossentropy' is employed since this is a multi-class classification problem.
        Metrics: Accuracy is used to gauge the model's performance.


Chapter 7: Model Training

    The neural network is trained using the preprocessed dataset. Training involves updating the model weights to minimize the loss function.
    7.1 Splitting Data

    Data is split into training and testing subsets to validate the model's performance on unseen data.
    7.2 Epochs and Batch Size

    Training for multiple epochs allows the model to see the data repeatedly and refine its weights. The batch size defines the number of samples used in each update of the model weights. We've chosen 50 epochs and a batch size of 32, which are common starting points.

Chapter 8: Model Evaluation

    After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to determine its predictive performance.
    8.1 Metrics

    We assess the model based on:

        Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
        F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful in imbalanced datasets.
        Confusion Matrix: Provides insight into misclassifications.

Chapter 9: Disease Prediction using the Trained Model

    Once trained, the neural network can be used to predict potential diseases based on a set of symptoms.
    9.1 Input

    The function accepts a list of symptoms (ICD-11 codes).
    9.2 Output

    The function returns the predicted disease ICD-11 code.
    Notes:

        Parameter Choices: Parameters like epochs, batch size, optimizer, and the architecture were chosen based on empirical evidence, best practices, and initial experimentation. Further optimization can be achieved through hyperparameter tuning.
        Future Enhancements: For better performance, consider regularization, batch normalization, early stopping, different architectures, feature importance analysis, and data augmentation.
